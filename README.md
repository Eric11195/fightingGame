Fighting Game in Javascript

There's quite a bunch of mecanics from fighting games since I'm a big fan of them. So even if it's quite simple there's still okizeme and mixup strategies, as the character, or at least the special moves are thought to be of a rushdown archetype.
Features:
-Life and time indicators
-Walk and dash(dash low profiles some moves)
-3 types of ground jumps
-2 types of aerial jumps
-Standing and crouching blocks, a special block on air that blocks everything, and a perfect block, if you block at the right time, that heals you.
-2 types of knockdowns, soft knockdown and hard knockdown (set up your okizeme and make them guess what side are u gonna be muahahaha, sorry im a Millia player) 
-8 normal attacks (classified on HIGH, MID, LOW and OVERHEAD, some of them have unique properties, hard knockdown, Wall Splat, Ground Bounce) and 4 special attacks with special inputs (quart circle forward + attack button  or twice down + attack button) two of them are chargable and cancellable(for combos and pressure), one is a multi-trayectory projectile, and the other is a launcher for combos.
-Frame data, startup, active and recovery, On-hit and On-block advantage.
-Combo system based on frame data and launcher moves. There's also ground bounce and wall bounce if you like being fancy. And also a wall splat, that is basically the combo ender.
-An anticombos system based on juggle decay.
-No grabs :( , i am too lazy to make a synchronized animation.

Instructions and video demonstrations on the following link. It is in spanish I may warn. There's no code explanations since it´s just a complete mesh. And there's very few comments on the code itself (things of my chaotic mind).

Feel free to use my code, or modify it. But it is horribly estructured, and there are probably lots of bugs. This project is not going to be further developed (it was a class project which got out of hand). If it is (inexplicably) useful for you, or if you have achieved to do something good with it, contact me or link me somewhere (even a little mention) on your state of the art javascript game xD. 
I´m relatively new to gitHub no idea how or even if it is possible to message or something similar. But hey, if you know, don't hesitate to do it if you have any question. I will probably ask, even if it's in twenty years from now.
